# Blazor CRUD Application with MudBlazor

## Introduction

This application is a demonstration of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using ASP.NET Core Blazor and MudBlazor components. It showcases the use of Blazor for building interactive web UIs using C# and the integration of MudBlazor for a rich, Material Design compliant user interface.

## Technologies

- .NET 8
- Blazor
- MudBlazor
- Entity Framework Core (for database operations)
